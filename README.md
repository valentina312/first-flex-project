# first-flex-project

vers 1.0
This was my very first attempt at creating a simple landing page. The goal was to put into practice what I learned when studying basic HTML and CSS, including flexbox. I think in this first version the CSS is too complicated, so I plan to come back later and try to make it more simple. In this first section the webpage is not responsive.
